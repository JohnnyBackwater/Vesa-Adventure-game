# Vesa-Adventure-game
Vesa Adventure is a 2D minigame I started somehwere in 2014. Game engine is made from scratch with pure Java and is quite messy, but I learned the from the process. 

Physics package is the latest thing I started to wokr on and it only has like a Point class. The project was pretty much abandoned at this point and I started to use Unity for my games.

This repository only contains the source code and no resourses, which include some textures that contain faces of people, who are not willign to show them in public. Also music will not work. You can make own music with MIDI files and spritesheets in 32x32 pixels or just go modify the source for your own textures if you want to build it. This is made in eclipse so importing the project to eclipse or similar program helps the building this game for testing. You can also ask me to build this game for you if you want to test it out.
